# Python-code-from-scratch-of-PCA-on-MNIST-and-then-perform-GMM-clustering.
Picture a technique that can simplify complex data while preserving its critical elements, like a magic
lens that brings clarity to chaos. PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is the key to unlocking these
possibilities, offering a fascinating journey into the world of data transformation and exploration.
Do the followings: 
a.) Perform PCA on MNIST and then perform GMM clustering. (Library can be used for SVD and
GMM) but PCA should be from scratch. PCA should be done for 32, 64 and 128 components.
Clustering should be done in 10, 7, and 4 clusters. 
b.) Visualize the images getting clustered in different clusters. 
c.) Please comment on cluster characteristics and comment with respect to previous task about
what difference you see. 
d.) Can you find the optimal number of components the PCA should choose which covers almost
all the necessary patterns in the data? Can you comment on where PCA can fail?
